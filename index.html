                    The election of the president and the vice president of the United States is
                    an indirect election in which citizens of the United States who are registered
                    to vote in one of the fifty U.S. states or in Washington, D.C., cast ballots not
                    directly for those offices, but instead for members of the Electoral College.
                    These electors then cast direct votes, known as electoral votes, for president,
                    and for vice president.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The candidate who receives an absolute majority of electoral
                    votes (at least 270 out of 538, since the Twenty-Third Amendment granted voting rights
                    to citizens of D.C.) is then elected to that office. If no candidate receives an absolute
                    majority of the votes for president, the House of Representatives elects the president;
                    likewise if no one receives an absolute majority of the votes for vice president,
                    then the Senate elects the vice president.

                    Over the last 50 years, two parties that dominated elections with electoral votes were Republicans and Democrats. 
                    Republicans, usually associated with the red color, are a left-wing party, favoring a republic over a monarchy and primarly 
                    liberal. Democrats on the other hand are right-wing conservatives whom are favoured by the upper-class of USA.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lines graph above shows that the interest in the Democratic party was always bigger than that in the Republic party, 
                    although the difference was never that big.

                    It is appereant that Democrats dominated the conservatives. Most of Democratic states in the USA are among the wealthiest. 
                    The barchart above shows clearly that most globaly popular states have always been leaning to the right.
